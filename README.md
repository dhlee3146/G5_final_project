## Detailed Activity Plan

### 01. Preview

**Activity:**
- Watch a 1.5-minute video related to the story.
- Pose a key question at the end of the video to engage students.

**Script:**
- Teacher: Class 5, before we start, we will watch a short video related to today‚Äôs class. There will be a question at the end, so please watch the video carefully.
- (Play the video)
- Teacher: So, what was the last question?
- Student: The video asked what was written on the parchment!
- Teacher: That's right. Shall we guess and share your thoughts?
- Student: It might be written about something eligible to take the treasure.
- Teacher: That‚Äôs a good idea! Then, let‚Äôs check after the class to see if your answers are correct!

### 02. Learning the Story

**Activity:**
- Use the Read-Aloud Practice App.
- Play audio files of sentences for students to repeat and practice pronunciation.

**Script:**
- Teacher: This sentence contains a relative pronoun. Listen carefully and repeat together! (Play the audio file)
- Student: (Repeats) ‚ÄúIt read: To those who seek adventure, true treasure lies not in gold but in the journey and the friendships forged along the way.‚Äù

### 03. Grammar Teaching

**Activity:**
- Use slide images to explain relative pronouns.

**Script:**
- Teacher: Please focus on the screen. Today, we are going to learn about relative pronouns. A relative pronoun is a word that is used to connect an independent clause to a relative clause. It acts as a glue, combining two sentences into one. Do you all understand?
- Student: I understand.
- Teacher: Good. In these two sentences, 'who' and 'which' are relative pronouns.

### 04-1. Personal Activity for Grammar Learning

**Activity:**
- Use the Sentence Combiner App to create sentences with relative pronouns.
- Share sentences on Padlet.

**Script:**
- Teacher: Everyone, scan the QR code on the screen to access Padlet. You can find the post titled "Personal Activity." Our first activity is to make sentences using relative pronouns. When you type two sentences about one person, a combined sentence will be made. Don‚Äôt forget to use the pronoun in the subject position of the second sentence. I‚Äôll give you 3 minutes. Make one sentence and upload it on the Padlet. If you have any questions, please raise your hand.

### 04-2. Group Activity for Story Comprehension

**Activity:**
- Use the Multiple Question App to test story comprehension.
- Upload results to Padlet.

**Script:**
- Teacher: Look for the Group Activity post. Click on the link for a quiz to test your understanding of the story. Solve the questions with your group members, capture your score, and upload it to Padlet. You have 5 minutes. Start your activity!

### 05. Feedback on Group Activity

**Activity:**
- Review the group activity results and provide feedback.

**Script:**
- Teacher: Times up! Please upload your screen image to the Padlet. Let's take a look. It seems everyone did well on questions 2 and 3, but many got question 1 wrong. Shall we review this question together?

### 06. Review through Word Cloud App

**Activity:**
- Use a word cloud to review key points of the lesson.

**Script:**
- Teacher: Let's recall what we‚Äôve learned about the story today. What words do you see?
- Student: I can see the word ‚Äòparchment‚Äô!
- Teacher: Can you tell me about the word 'parchment'?
- Student: In the parchment, there is a lesson that the real treasure lies in the journey and the friendship forged on the way!
- Teacher: Yes, that's right. You all learned well!

### 07. Giving Assignment

**Activity:**
- Assign homework using the Cloze Question App.
- Students rearrange fragments to form complete sentences with relative pronouns.

**Script:**
- Teacher: Now, let‚Äôs give you an assignment! You can find the post about the assignment. The task is to rearrange fragments to make a complete sentence involving relative pronouns. Read the instructions carefully, and upload your screen image to Padlet. Complete your assignment by the next class on June 12th. See you next class!

## üòç Our story
   
< The Cave of Whispers >

In the small town of Willow Creek, nestled between lush hills and a winding river, four friends‚ÄîEmma, Jake, Mia, and Liam‚Äîstumbled upon an old map tucked inside a dusty library book titled "Legends of the Lost." The map depicted a hidden cave known only as the Cave of Whispers, rumored to hold a mysterious treasure that no one in Willow Creek had ever found.
The friends, buzzing with excitement, planned an adventure to discover the cave. They packed their backpacks with essentials: flashlights, a compass, snacks, and a camera to document their journey. With the map as their guide, they set off early one Saturday morning, the summer sun casting long shadows through the forest.
Their journey led them through thick woods where the light danced between the leaves, creating patterns on the forest floor. Birds chirped melodiously, providing a soundtrack to their expedition. After hours of hiking, the map directed them to a hidden path veiled by overgrown bushes. Pushing through, they finally came to a halt in front of a towering cliff face. In its center, concealed behind hanging vines, was the entrance to the Cave of Whispers.
With hearts racing, the friends entered the cave. Inside, it was cool and damp, the air filled with the echo of dripping water. Their flashlights cut through the darkness, revealing ancient rock formations and walls that seemed to hum with old secrets.
As they ventured deeper, they found carvings on the cave walls‚Äîmysterious symbols that none of them could decipher. Mia, who had a keen interest in history, took several photos, hoping to research them later.
Suddenly, Jake, who was leading, halted. Ahead, in a small clearing within the cave, lay a wooden chest. It was old and covered in dust, with intricate carvings that shimmered under their flashlight beams. The friends exchanged looks of awe and nervous excitement. Liam carefully opened the chest to reveal its contents: golden coins, sparkling jewels, and a parchment that looked centuries old.
Emma carefully unfolded the parchment, revealing a message written in an elegant script. It read: "To those who seek adventure, true treasure lies not in gold but in the journey and the friendships forged along the way."
The friends sat back, the weight of the words sinking in. They realized that the real treasure was their shared adventure‚Äîthe challenges they overcame together and the memories they created.
As they left the cave, the sun was setting, casting a golden glow over the landscape. They didn‚Äôt take anything from the chest, choosing instead to leave it for the next group of adventurers. Back home, they shared their story, the mysterious symbols, and the sage words of the parchment. The Cave of Whispers had given them a treasure far greater than they had imagined: a story of friendship, courage, and adventure that they would cherish forever.
